Robotrek Finals
8th November, 2020
1PM - 8PM

Problem Statement:
Build a left-wall following robot capable of completing the provided course in a Gazebo world and reading AR Tags. The challenge consists of the following four parts:

Development of URDF/XACRO model of the robot with appropriate sensors. This includes all the plugins and sensors required for the robot to be able to follow a wall.

Execution of left-wall following behaviour in the provided Gazebo world. This includes creating all the required nodes to be able to execute this behaviour.

Reading AR Tags placed on the wall, publishing their Tag ID on the topic /AR_Tag_ID_Topic and saving the Tag ID for each Tag in a .txt file.

Bonus Task: Develop and store a map of the provided Gazebo world as a .pgm file.

Please note that if a team is unable to develop the robot model or any of the required plugins/sensors, they may request the organisers for a readymade body with the required plugins/sensors. However, points shall be deducted based on the degree of completion of the body by the team.

Once the repository has been made, follow the given steps to submit the solutions.
Navigate to the root of the Workspace Directory on your device after finalising the solutions.
git remote add origin https://github.com/Robotrek-TechTatva
git add .
git commit -m ‘team_name_submission’
